<h4> TheFit </h4>
  <ul class="proposalLi">
    <li> Identity </li>
    <p>Whether we like it or not, appearance is the first thing one notices about another individual. Ultimately, it says a lot about the person. Thefit aids in choosing a perfect outfit for any occasion whether it be casual, a night-out, or simply day to day activities. It is an outfit generator, customizable depending on different body types, varying skin tones, current trends, and preferences of modesty.
    </p>
    <li> Problem </li>
    <p>It gets increasingly time consuming and difficult to pick an outfit every morning that flatters each individuals’ skin tones, body types, keep up with the current trends, and dress code.
    </p>
    <li> Solution </li>
<p> This product makes for a perfect solution for a rushed morning when one can’t decide what to wear or simply wants an outfit they normally wouldn’t pick out. Our product will efficiently generate an outfit based on the settings the user has customized, saving time and stress.</p>
    <li> Target Market </li>
    <p> The target audience is mostly those who have trouble with picking the perfect outfit for an occasion or need help changing up their current style.</p>
    <li> Competition </li>
    <p> There isn’t a very well developed product that achieves the same results as our product. So far, there is no competition.</p>
    <li> Revenue Streams </li>
    <p>To generate revenue, our product will display occasional ads, most of them falling under the same category that our app does. (fashion items, sales, stores). Our product will also recommend similar clothing items to purchase, unique to each users’ taste. When bought through the provided link, we will be generating revenue through affiliate marketing. </p>
    <li> Marketing Activities </li>
    <p>We will communicate with our users through messages or emails, and targeted social media ads. Tiktok will be a large part of our marketing activities as it is a quick way to advertise a business on such a large scale. </p>
    <li> Expenses </li>
    <p> So far, nothing as everything is accessable online and the developers are willing to work without pay. </p>
      <li> Team And Key Roles </li>
    <p>Currently it is only Jana Daouk and Zaenb Al ameri, the inventors, developers, marketing and business team responsible for this product. As we further work to improve our product, we will be looking for other employees to contribute and help us grow.
    </p>
    <li> Milestones </li>
    <p> As business grows, we hope to become a daily part of millions of lives. We also hope to maybe one day add extra paid features too to create more revenue.
