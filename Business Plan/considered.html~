<h1> Considered & Accepted Proposals </h1>

<h4> Considered </h4>
  <ol>
    <li> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/benjamin-haines/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" > The City Planner </a> </li>
    <p>  I really think this would build a sense of community especially for those who just moved to a different neighborhood, but I also think that an instagram page is sufficient as well. To me, that is good enough. However, I did really like the reminder idea. Even though I see myself using this in the future, I would be more interested in pursuing other projects that targets another issue. </p>
    <li> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/mehak-jay/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" > AI Therapist </a> </li>
    <p>   As much as I wish that this was a thing, I think this project should at least incorporate a real therapist. I'm not ready to take on that big of a responsibiliy to give feedback about peoples' personal problems when I'm not qualified to do so. However, with the right parameters and execution, this is a terrific idea, especially for those who cannot afford therapy. </p>
    <li>  <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/melanie-lopez-de-nava-reza/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" > The Restaurant Picker </a> </li>
    <p> The reason I considered this project is because I would actually use it. Picking a restaurant is an annoying task to do, so this would solve so many issues. Ultimately, I decided to reject this proposal beacause I am more interested in another project.   </p>
    <li> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/onik-hoque/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" > ShelterSafe </a> </li>
    <p> I considered this project because it is genuinely an awesome idea! I think society needs an app like this to exist, but normally during natural disasters, phones aren't as effective because of bad signal. I am not very well-informed about if gps works differently that you would still be able to upload live information. Finally, I decided to go another route because of those issues. </p>
    <li>  <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/shivangi-gupta/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" > Castaway </a> </li>
    <p> This has to already exist because it is so necessary. I love this idea because opening so many different tabs is so annoying and gets confusing. What stops me from pursuing this project is the idea that each website will provide a specific price. Naturally, people will browse through different websites to find the best deal, defeating the whole purpose. Having this product also compare prices would add a lot of value to it.   </p>
    <li> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/varun-natarajan/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" > Let's Go! </a> </li>
    <p> The reason I considered this is because I couldn't come up with a person who has never related to this issue before. The reason I rejected it though is because google maps has a similar feature and I was more interested in a different project that targeted another problem. However, I am sure this pitch has so much potential.</p>
    <li> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/brett-kaplan/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" > SchoolFood </a> </li>
    <p> I can't believe this isn't in use already because of its necessity. It would be so efficient, but I rejected it because I think we would run into many security issues with it as well as some chaos it could cause. Also, depending on some school and district laws, I think this would be difficult to actually put to use. However, if it comes out, I will be one of the first people to use it. </p>
    <li> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/william-hutchings/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" > Goose simulator </a> </li>
    <p> I already know that I would definitely try this game. There is also no denying that it is unique! It sounds so interesting, but I did decide to reject this one however, as I previously created a game and would like to try to create something new. I also am not a big fan of creating graphics and original art to use in the game. </p>
      <li> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/faraz-piracha/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" > Foob </a> </li>
    <p> Although I could see myself using this and exactly why I considered it, I love the website that already exists. I decided to reject the proposal as I would like to pursue another project. This website will require a lot of design and detail to compete in the market, and because of the practice in this area that I am recieving from working on this digital portfolio, I decided against this ISP.  </p>
    <li> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/vivek-maranganti/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" > Code Converter</a> </li>
    <p> Ultimately, I decided to accept this proposal because of the actual need for it that I experience first hand. It would save so much time and if made well, I think it has a lot of potential. It could be used on such a wide scale and I have yet to find one that works well. I think choosing this as my ISP would really help me with my coding and expose me to more coding languages, helping me grow in these specific areas.
