<p> The about me page is a very important part of this project, so we must have all pages functioning correctly. It was fixed and now we can move on to enhancements.</p>
	  </ul>
<h3> Challenges </h3>
    <p> <b> Scheduling Challenge: </b>Due to the EOC and the fact that this week was a B week, the first and only time we were in class was Thursday. We also had a mission to begin working on, so it was difficult balancing that with our ISP, upcoming AP exams, and Collin finals. Someone tampered with the about me page I had fixed just last week, so I had to fix that again, but otherwise, the website looks pretty clean and is almost ready, as we finalized some desings, resolved some errors, and added the feedback form. It was a tough week, but we also got the chance to work on our final presentation, as we planned for something a bit more time-consuming. Personally, I think it is coming along great, and will be worth all this extra effort. </p>
    <p> <b> Technical Challenge: </b> I am unable to put the website into a validator because I am uploading a file instead of a link. I fixed the errors I could identify, and will fix the link problem to continue debugging. </p>

  <h3> Challenges: </h3>
    <p> <b>Technical Challenge:</b> I was pushing a file, but I had not pulled the project before. I kept on messing with my github till I was not able to push or pull. It simply was not practical. So, I resorted back to VS code. I had issues with that too as I was not able to see our website. It was a nusance becasue it would either be blocked or it would not show up on the validator for me to fix some errors. As a group, we had a work around and solved it during our weekly synch-in. I was finally able to push everything! One of my team members is also struggling with github, so we did the feedback form on her tabby, and she is still attempting to push it. We will continue to work on that. </p>

    <li> Technical Challenges:
      <p> My team members and I were unable to fix my github issue, so to keep the project going, I am now using vscode. We also have many errors with the HTML and CSS in our website, but when I put the VSCode website into the browser and put it into the validator, it doesn't find the website. To solve that, one of my team member whose github is working is pulling it, and I am just using their link to fix the errors. It is working out until we figure out how to make it working properly. We are also dealing with errors regarding the conversions that we are actively trying to figure out.  </p>

    </li>
    <li> Scheduling Challenges:
      <p> The ISP's deadline is less than a month away, so we are trying to plan realistically according to that. We are squeezing in last minute additions and elimination features we find time-consuming and unnecessary. With this, the workload has definitely varied, so we adjusted the schedule. CS-III also have a mission, so some of our developers are pretty occupied as well. Our weekly synch-in was pretty quick this week due to those reasons.     </p>
    </li>

    <li> Interpersonal Challenges:
      <p> A team members began nitpicking at everyone's work. This lead to some personal conflicts between the members. This increased the tension in the group as the deadline, AP exams, and graduation approach. We resolved this by having a meeting with the entire group and talking it out with mediators to ensure the peace. This actually solved the problem and now we are all working together and collaborating normally.  </p>

  <ul class="jan2" >

    <li> Technical Challenges:
      <p> This week I faced github issues again. I researched and tried to fix it, but I wasn't able to. I wasn't able to access the project at all, but I worked on solving some errors with my team members and we made progress with the front-end. I continued to collaborate with my team members, and I have set up a call with one of the members in my group who is knowledgable in github. </p>

    </li>
    <li> Scheduling Challenges:
      <p>  With Ap exams approaching, we planned to finish the ISP before them in order to relieve some pressure off of us. This is causing us to accomplish more tasks per week. We also had trouble meeting this week due to our members' availability conflicts. We ended up meeting without one or two team members. To compensate for that, we keep a shared google document that contains the meeting's notes. It is where all the roles are assigned and useful links are available. It is shared in our ISP folder and easily accessible to all.</p>
    </li>

    <li> Interpersonal Challenges:
      <p>It is more difficult to communcate with the members who were not able to attend this week's meeting. They were assigned roles, but ultimately, it was less effective than if they were present. My github issues caused some of the members to think that I was not contributing to the project, and this was brought up in our meeting. Due to our effective communication and compassion towards each other, I explained my situation and they were understanding. All of them were officially aware of my circumstances and accomodated them as I continued to work with one of the team members. </p>

  <h4 class="translator" > 27-March-2023 </h4>
  <ul class="jan2" >

    <li> Technical Challenges:
      <p> After planning the website, we realized that we needed to iron out some details. We used this week to do that, and we began work on it. All this while the people assigned to working on the backend continue to resolve errors to allow for actual functionality. This was tough as we didn't make a lot of progress, but we did do tons and tons of research. The research was fruitful, but we now must figure out how to implement the research and use it to fix our errors. Many of CS-II were busy focused on making their misssions work as well. </p>

    </li>
    <li> Scheduling Challenges:
      <p> With CS-II still swamped with the missions, the workload was catching up to them. This was hard to manage, especially as the members are spread across different class periods. However, we still tried to make this work via text. We are a bit behind where we would like to be, but we had planned for falling behind, so we are still able to finish before the deadline. That gave us a nice grace period ad really reduced the pressure on us. It helped us stay organized.   </p>
    </li>

    <li> Interpersonal Challenges:
      <p> Is is a constant challenge to make sure we all hold each other accountable to stay on top of our own tasks. We usually resolve that by collaborating on the tasks where a member falls behund in order to keep the entire project going. This was the most prominent challenge we faced this week as some CS-II members were focused on their missions and needed assistance with their tasks. At the end, we collaborated with each other in order to ensure that there are no misunderstandings. </p>

      <h4 class="translator" > 20-March-2023 </h4>
      <ul class="jan2" >

	<li> Technical Challenges:
	  <p> With the CS II members focused on figuring out the mission mainly, they were tasked to accomplish less. Our website isn't where we want it to be yet. So, I was involved in that part for this week. I spent my time planning and researching different website designs and functionalities to find inspiration and create one that really fits our needs. It was crucial that we work together for the design and our next phase is to research its implementation. </p>

	</li>
	<li> Scheduling Challenges:
	  <p>  With CS-II trying to finish their missions, and CS-III being more free, there was a conflict in regards to the schedule. The CS-II members were less focused on the ISP and so we had to reschedule the call several times before being able to communicate properly. Nonetheless, everyone in the team is having scheduling conflicts, so it is difficult to set a meeting where everyone is available. We resolve this by accomodating the largest number of members available as well as taking notes during the meeting.     </p>
	</li>

	<li> Interpersonal Challenges:
	  <p> The workload was unbalanced as CS-III had more free time than CS-II members, who had missions to finish. This lead to less work being tasked to CS-II and we really relied on each other's help to get through this week. It was a real time mangement challenge accompanied by a lot of understanding and collaboration in the group. At the end of the day, we all understand the importance of compassion and collaboration in the group. </p>

    <li> Technical Challenges:
      <p> We are trying to move forward with our code, as we translate different methods and function, but we are facing many errors, and it is taking longer than expected. We are trying our best to colaborate to help each other and make the code function. We planned to do a lot of research and then come back and discuss what we found. We decided that collectively solving these challenges we are facing will really involve everyone in the project and make all the members more involved.</p>

    </li>
    <li> Scheduling Challenges:
      <p>  After spring break, everything is kind of in chaos as we are all adjusting back to the normal routine we established beforehand. We were not able to call because of the chaos, but we are trying to make things work over text. We communicate pretty frequently, but because of each of the members being spread across the different periods, it is more difficult to communicate. We all understand this problem and strive to put in the extra effort to make up for it.     </p>
    </li>

    <li> Interpersonal Challenges:
      <p> It is the week after spring break, and seeing as though we took the time off, we lost track of our momentum. Most of the members fell behind on their tasks, so our issues are mostly on how to catch up. So, we are trying to resolve that by scheduling a call to discuss our tasks for the week. With many members not fully accomplishing their tasks proficiently, we had a team meeting to discuss it proffessionally. We were able to resolve the issue without any major conflicts.</p>

    </li>

    <li> Scheduling Challenges:
      <p>  We have three different class periods included in the ISP, so finding a time where all six of the members area available takes some time. We resolve that by accomodating the schedule of the majority and taking notes in the meeting for anyone who could not show up. We did this to prepare for our MVP presentation.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li> Interpersonal Challenges:
      <p> A new member wants to come into the group and the MVP is due this week. This caused a weird change in dynamic, and we may not have enough tasks for everyone. We are having a team meeting to discuss this. We are going to dive into the impact of such a change on the work flow. We must talk about the pros and cons regarding this change.</p>

      Technical Challenges:
      <p> The github issue we were experiencing was finally resolved completely and everyone is able to work smoothly. During the actual coding of the software, we experienced some errors that we were able to resolve with a bit of extra research and collaboration. </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      Scheduling Challenges:
      <p> With the new compressed schedules after the snow storm, we collectively decided to skip check-in call this week, and have a quick conversation over text regarding individual progress. </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      Interpersonal Challenges:
      <p> With one of the team members not completely collaberating, we resolved this through a friendly conversation, and it turned out to be a misunderstanding. We are now all aware of the tasks assigned to all members, and we hold each other accountable within reason.</p>

    <li>
      Technical Challenges:
      <p> Two of the team members were still unable to push into the shared repository, and due to the snow storm we were not able to resolve that at the beginning. We later fixed the issue with help from Mr. Ben. We are now able to comfortably work in the shared repository. </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      Scheduling Challenges:
      <p> The snow storm hit this week, so a lot of our school work got messed up, but we still managed to stay on schedule for the ISP. Despite the difficulties with the conflicting schedules, everything was re-organized to put us back on track. </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      Interpersonal Challenges:
      <p> Many of the team members were lacking in some aspect of knowledge, so the reiteration of the importance of learning the information was necessary. Despite the snow storm, most of the members were able to be at the weekly check-in with the exception of one missing member.  </p>

    <li>
      Technical Challenges:
      <p> This week, it became apparent that two of the team members were not able to push or pull anything. To resolve this issue, we seeked the help of Mr.Ben to add us them as contributors. As to not stop the progress of the project, we collectively decided to continue the work on an alternative directory then push it to the actual one once we resolve the issue. </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      Scheduling Challenges:
      <p> Due to the technical issues, it created a small delay, but luckily we did not fall too far behind and should be right back on schedule to present our MVP (minimum viable product) on time. Nonetheless, our schedules continue to conflict and we are all simply trying to work through it.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      Interpersonal Challenges:
      <p> Some of our members are not too familiar with some of the languages we will be using, and due to other commitments it is taking many time to learn them. This, however a nusance in our progress, is included in our GANTT chart, and we are collectively working together to help one another grow in their programming weakspots. </p>

    <li>
      Technical Challenges:
      <p> Instead of connecting the github repository through the shell, I downloaded vs code and github desktop, with the help of one of my team members. With this, I was easily able to access everything. We also had trouble pushing the new written code, but after discussing, we were able to figure out the issue, and now everything is visible to everyone. </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      Scheduling Challenges:
      <p> We had our first meeting and it went well; however due to each of our busy schedules, some people could not make it. To resolve that, we will plan the meetings on a week to week basis to accomodate any commitments we each might have. We also set the first deadlines for each of our assigned tasks and despite each of our full schedules, we are still managing to make progress.    </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      Interpersonal Challenges:
      <p> So far, we are all getting along pretty well, however a small conflict arose regarding the design of the website. We ended up compromising, and tried to prioritize the project instead of our own wants. It went pretty well and it looks better than our individual designs. </p>

<ul class="jan2" >

  <li> 
    Technical Challenges: 
   <p> Considering we all needed to collaborate on all the coding, designing, and planning, we needed a place where we could all easily access anything one team member creates, so we resolved this by sharing a google folder. I also had trouble figuring out how to clone the git repository to be able to code and share my progress, but I was helped by a team member and downloaded several programs on my laptop that help me with this process.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
   Scheduling Challeges: 
  <p> Due to the difference of our classes and conflicting schedules, as a team, we collectively decided to conference at least one time a week, either Monday or Tuesday. However, we are also able to communicate through text messages, but the team meetings are set at the beginning of the week. This is to divide tasks, track progress on the GANTT chart we have, and discuss our concerns. So far, we are on schedule despite the pressures of school and out of school commitments. </p>
    </li>

  <li>
   Interpersonal Challenges:  
  <p> The idea of this project really stood out to me, so I was really excited to join, but I did not previously know any of the original members. This created a kind of ice between the goup members. Recently, one of the members reached out to me via email, and we created a discord. This method of communication is not the most efficient one as I find groupchats through messages to be more accessible, but I do respect their wishes of privacy. I decided to put more effort into our communication to ensure that no miscommunications and conflicts occur, while respecting their wishes.</p>

    <li> Software engineer: <p>  As a software engineer, one would have to have knowledge of computer science principles and practices to be able to develop programs, games, run control systems, debug, build software… In this role, I think I would grow a lot, as although I have some knowledge, I still have a lot to learn. I would be a good fit here, but I would have to work a lot and research to be able to complete this role to the level to which it should be completed.
    </p> </li>
    <li>  QA engineer: <p>  A Quality Assurance engineer is responsible to ensure the absence of issues and bugs in a program. They collaborate with developers to fix those bugs to ensure the product launches with minimal issues. I think I would perform averagely in this role as it doesn’t seem to be difficult. To fulfill this role, one would have to be detail-oriented and attentive to the order in which the algorithm is executing to be able to determine where the error is. I think with the collaboration of the software engineer, I would be able to do a decent job here in identifying the bugs in the program and fixing them.
    </p>  </li>
    <li> Project Manager: <p> A project manager would be responsible to make sure all aspects of the product are being executed according to a set plan with deadlines and completed according to those standards. I think I would be a good project manager as I am a consistent person who is able to follow up with many different aspects of a project. Although, I do think that this role in general tends to need a very diplomatic person, as many interpersonal issues may occur. Luckily, I do consider myself diplomatic, yet firm at the same time, but these skills do need polishing. </p>
    </li>
    <li>  Product Manager: <p> A product manager is responsible to identify the customer’s needs and the goals or ambitions that the product must fulfill. This role requires the person to recognize what success looks like for the specific product. I think I would do an average job in this role because our product is a very useful one and if executed correctly, will be a huge success. The product already has a huge demand, so I think I would do a good job handling the rest of the duties of this role. </p>
    </li>
    <li> Release Engineer: <p> They work to make sure softwares are built and released with no issues. They also create code that links different applications together. Working closely with QA engineers, a release engineer makes sure these products meet certain standards before being released to be used publicly. I have absolutely no experience completing this job as I have never done this before, but am willing to learn. I think this would be a good opportunity for me to grow or simply to shadow one doing the job. </p>
