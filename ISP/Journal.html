      Technical Challenges:
      <p> This week, it became apparent that two of the team members weren't able to push or pull anything. To resolve this issue, we seeked Mr.Ben's help to add us them as contributors. As to not stop the progress of the project, we collectively decided to continue the work on an alternative directory then push it to the actual one once we resolve the issue. </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      Scheduling Challenges:
      <p> Due to the technical issues, it created a small delay, but luckily we didn't fall too far behind and should be right back on schedule to present our MVP (minimum viable product) on time. Nonetheless, our schedules continue to conflict and we are all simply trying to work through it.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      Interpersonal Challenges:
      <p> Some of our members aren't too familiar with some of the languages we will be using, and due to other commitments it is taking many time to learn them. This, however a nusance in our progress, is included in our GANTT chart, and we are collectively working together to help one another grow in their programming weakspots. </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      Technical Challenges:
      <p> Instead of connecting the github repository through the shell, I downloaded vs code and github desktop, with the help of one of my team members. With this, I was easily able to access everything. We also had trouble pushing the new written code, but after discussing, we were able to figure out the issue, and now everything is visible to everyone. </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      Scheduling Challenges:
      <p> We had our first meeting and it went well; however due to each of our busy schedules, some people couldn't make it. To resolve that, we will plan the meetings on a week to week basis to accomodate any commitments we each might have. We also set the first deadlines for each of our assigned tasks and despite each of our full schedules, we are still managing to make progress.    </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      Interpersonal Challenges:
      <p> So far, we are all getting along pretty well, however a small conflict arose regarding the design of the website. We ended up compromising, and tried to prioritize the project instead of our own wants. It went pretty well and it looks better than our individual designs. </p>

<div class="businessProposal" >
  <h4 class="translator" > 9-Jan-2023 </h4>
<ul class="jan2" >

  <li> 
    Technical Challenges: 
   <p> Considering we all needed to collaborate on all the coding, designing, and planning, we needed a place where we could all easily access anything one team member creates, so we resolved this by sharing a google folder. I also had trouble figuring out how to clone the git repository to be able to code and share my progress, but I was helped by a team member and downloaded several programs on my laptop that help me with this process.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
   Scheduling Challeges: 
  <p> Due to the difference of our classes and conflicting schedules, as a team, we collectively decided to conference at least one time a week, either Monday or Tuesday. However, we are also able to communicate through text messages, but the team meetings are set at the beginning of the week. This is to divide tasks, track progress on the GANTT chart we have, and discuss our concerns. So far, we are on schedule despite the pressures of school and out of school commitments. </p>
    </li>

  <li>
   Interpersonal Challenges:  
  <p> The idea of this project really stood out to me, so I was really excited to join, but I didn't previously know any of the original members. This created a kind of ice between the goup members. Recently, one of the members reached out to me via email, and we created a discord. This method of communication is not the most efficient one as I find groupchats through messages to be more accessible, but I do respect their wishes of privacy. I decided to put more effort into our communication to ensure that no miscommunications and conflicts occur, while respecting their wishes.</p>

    <li> Software engineer: <p>  As a software engineer, one would have to have knowledge of computer science principles and practices to be able to develop programs, games, run control systems, debug, build software… In this role, I think I would grow a lot, as although I have some knowledge, I still have a lot to learn. I would be a good fit here, but I would have to work a lot and research to be able to complete this role to the level to which it should be completed.
    </p> </li>
    <li>  QA engineer: <p>  A Quality Assurance engineer is responsible to ensure the absence of issues and bugs in a program. They collaborate with developers to fix those bugs to ensure the product launches with minimal issues. I think I would perform averagely in this role as it doesn’t seem to be difficult. To fulfill this role, one would have to be detail-oriented and attentive to the order in which the algorithm is executing to be able to determine where the error is. I think with the collaboration of the software engineer, I would be able to do a decent job here in identifying the bugs in the program and fixing them.
    </p>  </li>
    <li> Project Manager: <p> A project manager would be responsible to make sure all aspects of the product are being executed according to a set plan with deadlines and completed according to those standards. I think I would be a good project manager as I am a consistent person who is able to follow up with many different aspects of a project. Although, I do think that this role in general tends to need a very diplomatic person, as many interpersonal issues may occur. Luckily, I do consider myself diplomatic, yet firm at the same time, but these skills do need polishing. </p>
    </li>
    <li>  Product Manager: <p> A product manager is responsible to identify the customer’s needs and the goals or ambitions that the product must fulfill. This role requires the person to recognize what success looks like for the specific product. I think I would do an average job in this role because our product is a very useful one and if executed correctly, will be a huge success. The product already has a huge demand, so I think I would do a good job handling the rest of the duties of this role. </p>
    </li>
    <li> Release Engineer: <p> They work to make sure softwares are built and released with no issues. They also create code that links different applications together. Working closely with QA engineers, a release engineer makes sure these products meet certain standards before being released to be used publicly. I have absolutely no experience completing this job as I have never done this before, but am willing to learn. I think this would be a good opportunity for me to grow or simply to shadow one doing the job. </p>
    </li>
